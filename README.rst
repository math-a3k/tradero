``tradero`` is a tool for achieving self-funding via trading.

Self-funding means generating the means independently to cover a budget in order to opt by the value it produces rather than out of economic necessity (financial freedom).

It tracks Symbols in an `Exchange`_ with a time resolution, calculates indicators, presents them in an useful way and provides automatization through trading bots so the user can perform trading more effectively.

The application is available at https://tradero.dev

The full documentation is at https://tradero.readthedocs.io or the `/docs` directory.
