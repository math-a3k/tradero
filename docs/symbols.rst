A Symbol [1]_ is a market of an asset pair.

An asset pair consists of a base asset and a quote asset.

The base asset will be priced with the quote asset.

I.e. ``ETH/BUSD`` is the market where Ethereum is exchanged for Binance USD.

Symbols are loaded or updated with the :ref:`load_symbols` command and are also available through the REST API [2]_ and websockets [3]_.
