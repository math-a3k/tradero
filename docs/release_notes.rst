``tradero`` v0.1
================

Puimayen, September, 4th, 2023

Very happy to announce the first point release of ``tradero`` - *a tool for achieving self-funding via trading*.

This release's focus was on providing the infrastructure for tracking indicators and automatizing the trading on Binance.

As a result, ``tradero`` delivers a scalable cloud-ready FOSS solution that provides:

- A plug-in indicator architecture that allows to easily extend the market information,
- A bot framework that allows to easily automate trading based on that information, and
- AI integration

The next release's focus will be data-driven strategies in order to maximize the effectiveness of the infrastructure.

Happy Coding & Trading!!!
